            <h2>About Bureau Of Immigration</h2>
            <pre> Bureau of Immigration (BoI) was setup in 1971 by Government of India to undertake Immigration<br> function in the country. BoI is headed by Commissioner of Immigration and assisted by FRROs for<br> immigration facilitation service at airports and work relating to registration of foreigners under various<br> Acts and Rules. Altogether, there are 86 Immigration Check Posts all over India, catering to<br> international traffic. Out of these, 37 ICPs are functioning under the BoI, while the remaining are<br> being managed by the concerned State Governments.  At present, there are 12 FRROs in major cities<br> i.e. Delhi, Mumbai Kolkata, Chennai, Amritsar, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Calicut, Kochi, Trivandrum,<br> Lucknow and Ahmedabad. Apart from this, there are 12 Chief Immigration Officers in the cities<br> i.e. Goa, Jaipur, Gaya, Varanasi, Nagpur, Pune, Mangalore, Trichy, Coimbatore, Bagdogra,<br> Chandigarh and Guwahati. At remaining places District Superintendent of Police (SP) or the prescribed <br>authority functions as FRO to facilitate foreigners.

                To strengthen the Immigration system, a modernization programme viz. Mission Mode Project on<br> Immigration, Visa Foreignersâ€™ Registration and Tracking (IVFRT) has been undertaken by MHA/BoI, <br>with the assistance of  National Informatics Center(NIC). Under the project, all the Indian Missions,<br> Immigration Checkposts  (ICPs), FRRO/FRO offices are being computerized and networked to develop<br> a secure and integrated delivery framework to facilitate   legitimate travelers.
